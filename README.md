# Care Comrade
## Purpose
Have you ever found yourself in an emergency health situation and everything is just too much to deal with and you need a quick solution? 
Well look no further because we have an app just for that called **Care Comrade!!**
## Why we created Care Comrade?
Care Comrade was created for... 
- People who don’t have access to efficient healthcare
- Someone who need a quick solution
- People who need answers to health-related emergencies since googling in such circumstances can get overwhelming
## Some problems we aim to fix
- In 2022, 25.6 million people didn’t have access to healthcare
- 68,000 Americans die annually while healthcare companies make $69 billion in profits
- Most of these people come from low-income families that have one worker in the house
## Future Iterations
In the future, we hope to expand the possibilities of our app. This includes: 
- Expanding the number of scenarios 
- Implementing an AI chatbot to asist users during emergencies 
- Video tutorials for certain situations
- A detailed website about our mission
